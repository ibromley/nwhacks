# Transactia

Welcome to Transactia! Transactia is a web based application designed to provide consumer insight to users by aggregating local mircotransaction data. This application is designed to benefit both businesses and consumers. The ultimate goal of the Transactia is to improve the consumer experience and support the competitive economy. We believe that  increasing access to a anonymous transaction datacenter will lead to more knowledgeable consumers and assist local businesses.

# How does it Work?

Users of the service will have their micro-transactions recorded. By mircotransaction we mean to collect small purchases made often, not large payments, paychecks or other banking information. These purchases include groceries, dining, retail, and entertainment, among other industries. By combining receipt , timestamp, and location data, consumer trends can be visualized. What item's are most popular? When are they most often bought? Which generate the most profit? All of these question can be answered.

A primary advantage of Transactia is it's ability to track consumer options. When a new store or product is available, Transactia will add the product to it's database. By comparing similar products and factoring in the user's preferences, Transactia can suggest less expensive and more popular items. A custom algorithm was developed to rank existing options, giving the consumer the power of knowledge and choice. Daily purchases, such as coffee, lunch, and groceries, are evaluated based on price, distance to user, and popularity and presented to the user. Transactia provides a current and actuate financial model of consumer behavior and consumer market options.
